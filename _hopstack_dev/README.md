# Put some Hops in your code craft.

HopStack is a beautifully crafted application stack for software teams. It's great for people who already build scalable applications using AngularJS, Bootstrap, Coffeescript, and SASS
and is easy enough for anyone who understands HTML5, jQuery, and CSS. 

HopStack is also a uniquely crafted blend of fine javascript malts, streamlined workflows, and beautiful hops and skips to essential interface form & function.

HopStack is great for new projects like those found in hackerspaces, creative collectives, and startup / cowork spaces. 

- Easy install
- Easy deploys
- Easy craftability
- Open source
- Transparent & Secure
- Wiki Documentation
- Low cost

HopStack was built to consume things like Zapier, IFTTT, Firebase, and JSON... and that is all. It can, of course, consume Mongo or Couch or any data layer you wish.

Software designers, developers, hackathoners, and product owners can create and prototype applications and complex interactions with more than simple CRUD interfaces.

* Hopstack is for API developers, data researchers, tech journalists, and growth hackers.
* HopStack if for small, lean teams or large multi-disciplinary teams; and those that are in transition between the two.  
* HopStack is for the craftsman and the craftswoman, both of whom value their time on earth and how they spend it - 
 * and would prefer to create a quality product in less of their overall time.
* HopStack is for the 4 Hour Work Weekers who just can't stop building incredible ideas to help them pursue their life's passions. 
* Hopstack is for those digital artists that want to easily create interactions with users


## Some Core Features
We enjoy a good snifter (and the occasional pint) of fine craft beer, it's a hobby. To actually get time to do your hobby, you have to [GYSHIDO](http://gyshido.com). To [GYSHIDO](http://gyshido.com) with code, you need to work smarter.
So you can work smarter and drink more crafties, HopStack uses tools like...

* Solid Workflow with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io), scaffolding with Yo, dependencies (plugins) management with Bower, tasks automation with Grunt, local and native cloud deployments on popular PaaS platforms like Heroku, EngineYard, AppFog, Amazon AWS, Rackspace, and more.
* [Grunt](http://roots.io/using-grunt-for-wordpress-theme-development/) for compiling LESS to CSS, checking for JS errors, live reloading, concatenating and minifying files, versioning assets, and generating lean Modernizr builds
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) for front-end package management
* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* The latest [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) via Google CDN, with a local fallback
* The latest [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) build for feature detection, with lean builds with Grunt
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) 
* [Angular directives for bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)
* Organized file and template structure
* ARIA roles and microformats
* Cleaner HTML output
